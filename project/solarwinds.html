												<tr>
													<td>Reconnaissance</td>
													<td>The attackers likely conducted extensive reconnaissance to identify and select SolarWinds as their target. 
                                                        This could have involved identifying vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential entry points.</td>
													
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Weaponization</td>
													<td>In this phase, the attackers would create or acquire the malicious payload, which, in the case of SolarWinds, was a trojanized software update. 
                                                        The malware was inserted into legitimate software, turning it into a weapon.</td>
													
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Delivery</td>
													<td> The attackers delivered the weaponized update to SolarWinds' software distribution channels, making it available to thousands of SolarWinds customers. 
                                                        The update contained the Sunburst malware.</td>
													
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Exploitation</td>
													<td>This is where the SolarWinds exploit occurred. The attackers exploited the trust in the SolarWinds supply chain by inserting their malicious code into the software update, which was then installed on the victims' systems. 
                                                        This was a critical phase in the attack.</td>
													
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Installation</td>
													<td>After successful exploitation, the malware was installed on the compromised systems. 
                                                        The Sunburst malware established persistence and began communication with command and control servers.</td>
													
												</tr>
                                                <tr>
													<td>Command and Control(C2)</td>
													<td>The malware communicated with external servers controlled by the attackers, allowing them to maintain control over the compromised systems, exfiltrate data, and issue further commands. 
                                                        This phase was a crucial part of the attack's success.</td>
													
												</tr>
                                                <tr>
													<td>Actions on Objectives</td>
													<td>The ultimate objective of the SolarWinds exploit was to conduct espionage, steal sensitive data, and potentially compromise the national security of the United States. 
                                                        This phase involved exfiltrating data, conducting lateral movement, and achieving the attackers' goals.</td>
