I grew up in a state called PortHrcourt for my first 13 years. Nigeria is a really beautiful country, 
also one of the richest countries in Africa. we have diffrent lovely cuisines, my favourite at the moment is a 
dish called "Beans and Plantain". The combination is just heavenly, and its also very rich in protein. We have other
 dishes like; Jollof rice, Abacha, eba and varieties of soup, and so on.</p>

cooking and watching movies, horror precisely. I also love to try out different meals and recipes, I love music, Melancholy specifically.
My favorite artiste at the moment is Adele.</p>

<p>I currently don’t specialize in any fields right now. I’m still open to learning more skills and specialize in a field soon enough. 
    I enjoy web designing and programming. I’m more of a front end developer, not really familiar with Back end developing.</p>

<h2>My Education</h2>

<p>I am an IT(information technology) student who began studying in spring 2021. 
    I am currently in my 3rd year second semester. I’d say I’m a hardworking, resilient and smart student, 
    I’m a great team member and possibly a leader too.</p>
