       <ol>
           <li>Limited money and people, most small businesses usually don’t have a lot of money or staff and buying the right tools to stay safe online can be tough.</li>
           <li>Not knowing enough (Lack of Knowledge and expertise), people in the business might not know a lot about online safety</li>
           <li>Data protection </li>
           <li>Phishing attacks</li>
           <li>>outdated systems- These systems and softwares might not have the latest safety updates, which makes them easy targets for cyber attacks.</li>
           <li>Third-party Risks- small and medium-sized enterprises often rely on third-party vendors for various services and if these vendors have weak cybersecurity, it can indirectly affect the SME’s security.</li>
           <li>Mobile securities.</li></ol>
