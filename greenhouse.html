                            For local connectivity in a greenhouse IoT solution, you'll need a robust infrastructure that includes sensors that will gather environmental data, 
                            actuators that will control devices like irrigation systems, and a local network potentially using protocols 
                            like MQTT that will allow these devices to communicate. A gateway device may be necessary to collect and transmit data to a central server or cloud platform. 
                            This local infrastructure facilitates real-time monitoring and control within the greenhouse environment.</td>
