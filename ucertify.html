        <li>
        <p>This was when I was just logging in to Nessus to start my scanning activities</p>
        <a href="" class="image main"><img src="nessuslogin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        </li><br>
        <li><p>This was a step that required clearing all browsing data</p>

        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step we were prompted to create a new scan</p>
            <a href="" class="image main"><img src="creatingnewscan.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step, step 20, we were prompted to launch a general scan to check vulnerabilities</p>

        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step, we were observing the results of the general scan, in order to see the vulnerabilities</p>
            <a href="" class="image main"><img src="observingresultsofgeneralscan.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step, we are viewing the completed scan results of the general scan.</p>
            <a href="" class="image main"><img src="completedscanresults.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step, we are observing the vulnerabilities of the genereal scan.</p>

        </li><br>
        <li><p>In this step, we are executing step 1, which is the gvm-start command.</p>

        <li><p>In this step, step 3, we are setting up/observing the Greenbone secutiy assistant page.</p>

        <li><p>This is a picture that shows an unsuccessful task. So this was still one of the tasks where we were performing vulnerability scanning using OPenVas.
            The problem encountered here that hindered me from having a successful task was the inability to see abd click on the save button. Without being able to click on the save button because it was not visible,
            I wasn't able to save changes that were being made after inputting details necessary for certain fields, thus resulting in an unsuccessful task.
