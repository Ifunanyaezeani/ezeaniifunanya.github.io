        <h2>What is IOT- Internet of things ?</h2>
        <P>IoT stands for the "Internet of Things." It refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, 
        appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, 
        allowing them to collect and exchange data. The goal of IoT is to enable these connected devices to 
        communicate and interact with each other over the internet, leading to smarter, more efficient, 
        and automated processes.</P>

        <h2>The Key characteristics of IoT include:</h2>
        <ul>
